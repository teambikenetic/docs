Current instagram configuration:

* The @teambikenetic instagram account follows teammates and close allies. If they post to instagram with the hash tag #teambikenetic, the post will be re-posted by the @teambikenetic account. There are some issues with the timing on this that George is working on. 
* Please be aware that this can include non-public photos. If you do not want the account to do this let George know and the account will ignore your posts.
* Currently if a post that goes out also has the #bikeneticx hashtag, it will be added to the "Media" album in the race's Facebook page.

Work in progress:

* Improving search results/timing for the automatic posting.
* Would like to have posts to the @teambikenetic Instagram go to the team's Facebook page.
